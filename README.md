# TaskFlow — CLI Productivity Manager (C)
TaskFlow is a command-line task and class organizer written in C.
This project is built to strengthen core systems programming skills such as memory management, structured program design, and file handling, while gradually evolving into a more advanced backend system with database and API support.

The project follows a simple agile, sprint-based approach where features are added incrementally over time.

Current Features
Menu-driven command-line interface
Add a task
View tasks (in-memory)

(More features will be added as the project evolves.)

Tech Stack
Language: C
Compiler: GCC
Environment: Command Line / Terminal

Project Status

Phase 1 — Core C Foundations (In Progress)
The current focus is building strong fundamentals in C, including:
Program structure
User input handling
Arrays and basic data storage
Functions and modular design
Roadmap / Future Plans

Planned features and phases:

Phase 1 — Core C
Add / View tasks
Store multiple tasks in memory
